# Pancake.ManagedGeometry

Pancake.ManagedGeometry is a very preliminary library to provide basic geometric objects through fully-managed code. It has been the foundation of several in-house and released design plugins, features incl. daylight calcuation, visual analysis, etc. 

The data-model is rather simple and platform-neutral. Compared to other projects , this library doesn't and has no current plan to provide much *advanced* features, such as NURBS curves and solids. Besides, it has close to no support on (de)serialization, which is deemed to be the reponsibility of the caller.
