# Pancake.ManagedGeometry

Pancake.ManagedGeometry is a library to provide basic geometric objects through fully-managed code. It has been the foundation of several in-house and released design plugins, features incl. daylight calcuation, visual analysis, etc. 

The data-model is rather simple and platform-neutral. Compared to projects like [Hypar](https://github.com/hypar-io/Elements), this library doesn't provide much *advanced* features and has very few support on (de)serialization, which is deemed to be the reponsibility of the caller.
