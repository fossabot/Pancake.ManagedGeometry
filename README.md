Pancake.ManagedGeometry is a very preliminary library to provide basic geometric objects through fully-managed code. It has been the foundation of several in-house and released design plugins, features incl. daylight calcuation, visual analysis, etc. 

The data-model is rather simple and platform-neutral. Compared to other projects, this library doesn't have and has no current plan on much *advanced* features, such as NURBS curves and solids. Besides, it has close to no support on (de)serialization, which is deemed to be the reponsibility of the caller. This repo is designed as performance-oriented and provides very few abstractions.
